# Free the web apps

> Collection of [`.desktop` files](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html) allowing you to finally use web apps the way they were designed to be used.

## How to install

### Using the util

> Rembember to always have a look at scripts before executing with sudo!

```bash
curl -s https://ftwa.pulsar.dev/install.sh | sudo bash -s APP_NAME
```

### Manually

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the `.desktop` file to `/usr/share/applications`
3. Copy the `.png` file to `/usr/share/pixmaps`
4. Eventually you can update the `.desktop` file to run with another chrome executable

<!-- TODO: -->
<!-- ```bash
curl https://mathix.ninja/ftwa.sh | sudo bash
```

Will launch this CLI
```bash
Which web app would you like to install?
> todomate

DONE!
``` -->
